Modern real-world data typically have high dimensional ambient measurement spaces. Yet, they often exhibit low dimensional intrinsic structures that can be uncovered by geometry- or topology- oriented methods. As a result, recent years have seen significant interest and progress in geometric and topological approaches to representation learning.

The purpose of this challenge is to push forward the fields of computational differential geometry and topology, by creating the best data analysis, computational method, or numerical experiment relying on state-of-the-art geometric and topological Python packages. All participants will have the opportunity to co-author a white paper summarizing the findings of the challenge.

Deadline: May 2nd, 2021 at 23:59 PST (Pacific Standard Time).

Announcement of winners and prizes:

The first 3 winners will be announced at the [ICLR 2021 Virtual Workshop on Geometrical & Topological Representation Learning](https://gt-rl.github.io/) and advertised through the web.

The prizes are:

2000$ for the 1st place,
1000$ for the 2nd place,
500$ for the 3rd place.
We are looking forward to your contributions!
